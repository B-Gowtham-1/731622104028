# URL Shortener Microservice

This is a simple project that lets you shorten long URLs and get a short link you can share. It is built with Node.js (Express) for the backend and React for the frontend.

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Backend
- Open a terminal.
- Go to the backend folder:
  ```
  cd BackEnd
  ```
- Install dependencies (only needed once):
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Start the server:
  ```
  npm start
  ```
- The backend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. Start the Frontend
- Open a new terminal.
- Go to the frontend folder:
  ```
  cd FrontEnd/http-link-shortner
  ```
- Install dependencies (only needed once):
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Start the React app:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
- The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173` (or similar).

## Usage
- Open the frontend in your browser.
- Enter a long URL, set validity (optional), and a custom shortcode (optional).
- Click "Shorten URL" to get your short link.
